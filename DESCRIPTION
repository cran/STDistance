Description: Analysis of spatial relationships between cell types in spatial transcriptomics data. Spatial proximity is a critical factor in cell-cell communication. The package calculates nearest neighbor distances between specified cell types and provides visualization tools to explore spatial patterns. Applications include studying cell-cell interactions, immune microenvironment characterization, and spatial organization of tissues.
